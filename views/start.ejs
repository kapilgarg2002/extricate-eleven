            What would have otherwise been an enjoyable night turned out to be one of the most frightening experiences for everyone
            present at the Wheelerâ€™s house that day.
            Mike opened his eyes and saw the state of the room, it was as if the house was rummaged by a storm. Mike instinctively
            scanned the room for Eleven when his fears were confirmed. She was missing, they split themselves started looking for
            eleven. While this was a failed initiative, they stumbled upon what looked like a torn piece of someone's uniform that
            had the logo of Hawkins National Lab.
            Since Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler were out of town, the kids decided to call Detective Hopper along with Jonathan, Steve, and
            Billy for help. As soon as Hopper arrived, he told everyone that Hawkins Lab increased their security and only
            authorized personnel are allowed into the premises. They have some high-level passcode authentication system. This
            announcement robbed the room of any residual morale. However, the kids were determined to find their friend Eleven,
            whose disappearance wasn't an accident and wasn't unplanned either. They decided to split up into five teams of 2
            members each that would go about the town looking for anyone who could help them get into the lab or manage to sneak
            into the lab by themselves.
